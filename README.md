# kali4win
This is a project in the works which is basically a simulation of the kali linux terminal on windows, written in batch.
You can write basic linux commands in the terminal and pray that everything works as it should (some bugs do occur)
Not all commands are implemented as this is just a demo version and I hope to keep updating it to improve it.
Thanks for downloading! -from your young developer, anturaz
